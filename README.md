# TriviaGame

Created a Friends Theme-show Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.  There are 10 questions randomly generated with the countdown timer. The timer starts at 6 seconds for each question and answer. The game will give "Correct" if the User guesses correctly, along with a related gif/image. The game will give an "Incorrect, the right answer is "_____", along with a related gif/image. After 10 questions, the game will display the score and an option to restart the game. The questions will display in a different random order each time played.
